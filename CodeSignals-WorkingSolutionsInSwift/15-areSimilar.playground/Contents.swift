/*
 Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.
 Given two arrays a and b, check whether they are similar.
 
 For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [1, 2, 3], the output should be
 solution(a, b) = true.

 The arrays are equal, no need to swap any elements.

 For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [2, 1, 3], the output should be
 solution(a, b) = true.

 We can obtain b from a by swapping 2 and 1 in b.

 For a = [1, 2, 2] and b = [2, 1, 1], the output should be
 solution(a, b) = false.

 Any swap of any two elements either in a or in b won't make a and b equal.
